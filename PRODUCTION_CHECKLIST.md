   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /users/{userId} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. Add authorized domains in Firebase Console:
   - Go to Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings
   - Add your production domain

3. Set up monitoring:
   - Firebase Performance Monitoring
   - Firebase Crashlytics (for errors)
   - Google Analytics
