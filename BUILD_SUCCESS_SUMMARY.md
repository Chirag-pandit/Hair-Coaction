## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Firebase Dependencies ✅
**Problem**: Build failed with "Rollup failed to resolve import 'firebase/auth'"  
**Solution**: Installed the `firebase` package which was missing from dependencies

### 2. Git Merge Conflicts ✅
**Problem**: Merge conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) in `Sidebar.tsx`  
**Solution**: Resolved all conflicts, keeping the version with dark mode and user props support

### 3. Outdated Browserslist Database ✅
**Problem**: Warning about outdated caniuse-lite  
**Solution**: Updated browserslist database to latest version

### 4. Security Enhancement ✅
